2021-22 Season: November Update

# 2021-22 Season: November Update
The Iron Lions, FTC team 19922, finished 2021 strong. We finished our robot just in time for our First Preparatory Academy Qualifier. At the FPA qualifier we faced some challenges, and although we didn't qualify for elimination rounds we learned so much, and cannot wait for the American Academy of Innovation and Park City qualifiers. In addition we scheduled and met with over five teams, in preparation for our AAI and PC qualifiers.

Our Hardware team started learning how to use Inventor with help from FTC Team 10695, Theta Robotics. Unfortunately after our tournament we decided we needed to scrap our claw design and instead opt for an intake which allows us to intake pieces in a much less precise way which takes stress off the drivers. In addition we are going to be adding gears to our motors which ensures the motors do not burn out or bend. 

Our Fundraising and Outreach team spent these past two months writing and sending emails to local companies who might be interested in sponsoring our team. We also looked into places who would be interested in having a robotics team come and visit, after the season ends.

Our Software team really started picking up pace. We made improvements to the team's GitHub repository, added a CI, and made a very in-depth readMe. We also cleaned up the organization of the repo. The team started working on TensorFlow lite implementation. Our team's entire TeleOp mode was built. We built it by first making basic movement controls before moving on to the intake system and claw. Lastly we wrote  the Trajectories for the autonomous mode which we later just ended up using

We have two remaining qualifiers and a state championship if we qualify all in the month of January. We are excited to compete and hopeful to qualify for the State tournament. As always if you have any questions we would be happy to schedule a meeting.
