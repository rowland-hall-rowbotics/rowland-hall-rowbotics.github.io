2021-22 Season: October Update

# 2021-22 Season: October Update

The Rowland Hall Robotics teams have made great progress throughout the month of October. To start the Varsity team, the Monochromats, or team 16748, created a CAD model, to build a custom chassis. The Monochromats are also looking forward to being able to start printing custom pieces, which they are on track to start doing by mid-November. They have also decided on using Tensor flow and other collision prevention systems. Lastly, during September the Monochromats went to a Girls Club in Thanksgiving Point to increase interest in STEM. 

The JV team, the Iron Lions, which is team 19922 hit the ground running. On the hardware side, we created a cardboard model which we used to prototype. The robot we created also has 6‚Äù giant Mecanum Wheels. On the software side of things, we created a GitHub Repository, a plan for the rest of the season, and we decided to use roadrunner to map trajectories. 

Rowland Hall Robotics has created a website, started a relationship with the Rowland Hall Annual Fund and Fundraising group. We have also been able to get the generous help of some Rowland Hall Alumni, Alex Beaufort and Aaron Bentley. They have already been able to teach us so much in the physics, and engineering sectors.

To look towards the future of Rowland Hall Robotics, we are presenting at a School event later this month. In addition, the fundraising group will be sending out emails to potential sponsors in the coming weeks.

The Monochromats are planning on cutting and printing their custom chassis, by the end of the month. The software team is planning on working towards the final programs with the goal being the autonomous mode being finished my the end of December.

Lastly, the Iron Lions; are planning to compete at the December 10th Qualifier (Come out and Support Us) and are aiming to finish the entire robot by the end of the month. While the software team will be hard at work, figuring out how Tensor Flow works, and programming the robot, with specialization in the mecanum wheel movement and arm.
